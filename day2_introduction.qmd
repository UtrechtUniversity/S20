We covered a lot of material today, and plenty of exercises to match. In exercise 1, you replicate what we did in the lectures with respect to the basics of factor analysis. In exercise 2 and 3, we move on to multigroup regression and measurement invariance. At the end of the document, we have some bonus exercises on CFA and EFA.
