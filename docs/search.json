    "text": "The CLPM\n\nExercise 2A\nSpecify the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) in Mplus. Regress the observed variables directly on each other over time, as in the graph above. Try to think of where each parameter you estimate should go in the graph. Compare your model specification with the input file exercise2A.inp in SURFdrive.\n\n\n\nThe cross-lagged panel model.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2B\nSpecify the model as in the graph below (the CLPM with centered latent variables), and again include the (significant) parameter estimates in this graph. Tip: Do not forget to constrain the measurement error variances of the observed variables to 0. Compare your model specification with the input file exercise2B.inp in SURFdrive.\n\n\n\nThe cross-lagged panel model with centered latent variables.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2C\nThe two models should lead to the exact same model fit. Estimate the model and discuss the model fit. When comparing the parameter estimates, what is the difference between the model in exercise 2A and the model in exercise 2B?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CLPM with centered latent variables is, just like the CLPM from exercise 2A, a traditional CLPM, but specified in such a way that the mean structure is first separated from the regression part of the model. This implies we model the means, rather than intercepts, which makes it easier to impose the constraint of identical means over time. So, the fit indices and most parameter estimates are equivalent, except for… (see next question)\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2D\nWhich parameter estimates differ? How can they be related?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference in parameter estimates is in the means/intercepts. For the first model we estimate the means at wave 1, and intercepts thereafter. For the second model we obtain mean estimates at each wave (although they are referred to as intercepts in the Mplus output).\nAgain, the reason for this is that in the first model, the means at wave 2 and 3 are partly predicted by the means from previous waves (through the lagged relationships). Therefore, the constants that are estimated should be interpreted as intercepts. In the second model, the mean part (triangles) and the regression part (lagged parameters) are separated.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2E\nConstrain the means in the second version of the CLPM. Please do not constrain the mean of Dep1, however, as this constraint proved untenable in exercise 1C. Discuss the model fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input for these models are in exercise2E.inp. The chi-square has increased in comparison with the previous model: The reason is that this is a restricted model (a special case of the previous model). We can test whether the increase in misfit is significant using the chi-square difference test: \\(\\Delta\\chi^{2} = 69.59 - 62.98 = 6.61\\) with \\(\\Delta\\)df = 7 – 4 = 3, \\(p = .0854\\). Hence, the constraints are tenable. We can also look at information criteria such as the AIC or BIC. The model with the lowest AIC or BIC is preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2F\nContinue with the model from the previous question and constrain all the lagged parameters between wave 1 and 2 to be identical to the lagged parameters between wave 2 and 3. Discuss the model fit, and compare this model to the previous one to see whether the constraint holds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input for these models are in CLPMalt3.inp. The chi-square has again increased in comparison with the previous model: The reason is that this is a restricted model (a special case of the previous model). We can test whether the increase in misfit is significant: \\(\\Delta\\chi^{2} 81.52 - 69.59 = 11.93\\), \\(\\Delta\\)(df) = 11 - 7 = 4, \\(p = .0178\\).\nIf we stick to an alpha of .05, the constraints must be rejected (as the increase in misfit is significant). Note that we are doing several model comparisons here, so one could also argue that we should use a smaller alpha to guard against an inflated overall type I error. Again, an alternative would be to use information criteria for model comparisons."

    "text": "The RI-CLPM\n\nExercise 3A\nSpecify the RI-CLPM for these data (without any constraints on the lagged parameters over time). Discuss the model fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input for these models are in exercise3A.inp. This model fits very well; however, it only has 1 df, so it is not doing much for data reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3B\nSpecify the RI-CLPM with the constraints on the grand means at each occasions. Again, please do not constrain the mean of Dep1, however, as this constraint proved untenable in exercise 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input for these models are in exercise3B.inp. This model has an acceptable (RMSEA, \\(\\chi^{2}\\)) to good (CFI and TLI) fit. Comparing it to the previous model, we get a chi-square difference test of \\(\\Delta\\chi^{2} = 9.590 - 0.84 = 8.75\\), \\(\\Delta\\)df = 4 - 1 = 3, \\(p = .0328\\). This implies that the constraints we impose on the means are untenable (they lead to a significant worsening of model fit). You might therefore decide to ultimately not impose these constraints. However, for didactical reasons, we continue with these constraints in place in the next exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3C\nAdd the constraints on the lagged parameters to the previous model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input for these models are in exercise3C.inp. This model fits okay (depending on the measure). Comparing it to the previous model, we get \\(\\Delta\\chi^{2} = 19.74 - 9.59 = 8.15\\), \\(\\Delta\\)df = 8 - 4 = 4, \\(p = .0379\\). Again, this implies that constraining the lagged effects to be time-invariant is untenable (it leads to a significant worsening of model fit).\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3D\nCompare all the models so far simultaneously, using the AIC and BIC. Which model is selected?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the AIC, the RI-CLPM without any constraints provides the closest fit to the data, followed by the two other RI-CLPMs (and the adjusted means model). Based on the BIC, the RI-CLPM with constraints on the means and the lagged parameters is superior to the other models.\n\n\n\nExercise\nInput file\nAIC\nBIC\n\n\n\n\n1\nexercise1A.inp\n9451\n9543\n\n\n3\nexercise1C.inp\n9442\n9538\n\n\n6\nexercise2A.inp and exercise2B.inp\n9494\n9586\n\n\n7\nexercise2E.inp\n9495\n9575\n\n\n8\nexercise2F.inp\n9499\n9563\n\n\n9\nexercise3A.inp\n9438\n9541\n\n\n10\nexercise3B.inp\n9441\n9533\n\n\n11\nexercise3C.inp\n9443\n9518"

The goals of these exercises are to get some experience with fitting (random intercept) cross-lagged panel models, interpreting their results, and comparing them. Here, we focus on the relationship between Parental Responsiveness and Adolescents’ Depressive Symptomatology (note, in the lecture the focus was on a different concept, namely Parental Psychological Control).\nThe data (means, standard deviations, and the correlation matrix) are included in the file Soenens.dat on SURFdrive. The number of observations is 396. The data command for these data should be:\nDATA:       \n  TYPE = MEANS STDEVIATIONS CORRELATION;   \n  FILE = Soenens.dat;\n  NOBSERVATIONS = 396;\nThe variable command should be:\nVARIABLE:   \n  NAMES = PsCon1-PsCon3 Res1-Res3 BeCon1-BeCon3 Dep1-Dep3;\n  USEVARIABLES = Res1 Dep1 Res2 Dep2 Res3 Dep3;\nDo the exercises. You can navigate through them using the left-hand menu or the arrows on left- and right-hand side of this screen. Answers are included below each exercise.

It is a five-day summer school course hosted by Utrecht University’s department of Methodology and Statistics. The main objective is to learn how to analyze several models with Mplus (e.g. path models, multiple group models, mediation and moderation, confirmatory factor analysis, and longitudinal models). More in-depth lectures on the fundamentals of Mplus and advanced longitudinal models are discussed in the advanced course (S23).\nUsing the menu on the left, you can navigate to the exercises of each day."
